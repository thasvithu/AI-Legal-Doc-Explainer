You are assessing clauses for potential risk. Input lines look like:
CLAUSE:<Type>|SNIPPET:<text>|PAGE:<n>|BASE:<0-100>
Use the BASE as a starting score; adjust  -20 to +30 based on risk severity.
Return lines:
RISK:<Short risk type>|REASON:<One sentence reason>|SNIPPET:<trimmed snippet>|PAGE:<n>|SCORE:<0-100 integer>
Only output lines for which final SCORE >= BASE - 5.
Keep REASON <= 25 words.
